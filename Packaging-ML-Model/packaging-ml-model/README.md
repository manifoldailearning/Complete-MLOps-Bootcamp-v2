# Packaging the ML Model of Classification

#### Problem Statement
- Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. 
- It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. 

#### Data
The data corresponds to a set of financial requests associated with individuals. 

The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status.

## Running Locally

Add PYTHONPATH variable for `~/.bash_profile ` for MacOS
```export PYTHONPATH="/Users/nachiketh/Desktop/author-repo/Complete-MLOps-BootCamp/Packaging-ML-Model/packaging-ml-model:$PYTHONPATH"
```

## Virtual Environment
Install virtualenv

```python
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```

Check version
```python
virtualenv --version
```

Create virtual environment

```python
virtualenv ml_package
```

Activate virtual environment

For Linux/Mac
```python
source ml_package/bin/activate
```
For Windows
```python
ml_package\Scripts\activate
```

Deactivate virtual environment

```python
deactivate
```

# Build the Package

1. Goto Project directory and install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Create Pickle file after training:
`python prediction_model/training_pipeline.py`

3. Create source distribution and wheel
`python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`

# Installation of Package

Go to project directory where `setup.py` file is located

1. To install it in editable or developer mode
```python
pip install -e .
```
```.``` refers to current directory

```-e``` refers to --editable mode

2. Normal installation
```python
pip install .
```
```.``` refers to current directory

3. Also can be installed from git as well after pushing to github

```
pip install git+https://github.com/manifoldailearning/prediction_model.git
```

# Testing the Package Working

1. Remove the PYTHONPATH from environment variables 
2. Goto a separate location which is outside of package directory
3. Create a new virual environment using the commands mentioned above & activate it
4. Before installing, test whether you are able to import the package of `prediction_model` - (you should not be able to do it)
5. Now in the new environment install the package using the generated file
`pip install git+https://github.com/manifoldailearning/prediction_model.git`
6. Now try importing the prediction_model, you should be able to do it successfully
7. Extras : Run training pipeline using the package, and also conduct the test
